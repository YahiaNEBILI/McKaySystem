## Signals

This page is generated from module docstrings and static analysis of `check_id` constants.
Use it as an index; detailed semantics are in code and in the checker contract.

## Check IDs emitted

- `aws.s3.cost.bucket_storage_estimate`
- `aws.s3.governance.encryption_missing`
- `aws.s3.governance.lifecycle_missing`
- `aws.s3.governance.public_access_block_missing`

## Notes / limitations

- Cost estimates are best-effort unless explicitly enriched from CUR.
